# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical visual and usability issues in the Anclora Cortex application interface. The current implementation has several UI problems that affect user experience, including overlapping elements, inconsistent card designs, readability issues in dark mode, unwanted visual elements, and cramped spacing in the footer area.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to be properly positioned and accessible, so that I can easily switch between light and dark modes without visual interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme selector is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT overlap with any other UI elements
2. WHEN the viewport is resized THEN the theme selector SHALL maintain proper spacing from other elements
3. WHEN the theme selector is active THEN it SHALL remain fully visible and clickable
4. IF the screen size is mobile THEN the theme selector SHALL be repositioned to avoid conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text and UI elements to be clearly readable in both light and dark modes, so that I can use the application comfortably regardless of my theme preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL have sufficient contrast against backgrounds
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all interactive elements SHALL be clearly visible
3. WHEN switching between themes THEN no text SHALL become invisible or unreadable
4. WHEN hovering over elements in dark mode THEN hover states SHALL be clearly distinguishable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all feature cards to have consistent visual design, so that the interface looks professional and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the features section THEN all cards SHALL have the same icon presentation style
2. WHEN a card has an icon THEN it SHALL be displayed in a consistent circular container
3. WHEN cards are displayed THEN none SHALL have full-background icon overlays
4. WHEN hovering over cards THEN all SHALL have consistent hover effects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application header to be clean and professional, so that unwanted visual elements don't distract from the brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the navigation header THEN no unwanted colored boxes SHALL appear next to the app name
2. WHEN the beta badge is displayed THEN it SHALL have appropriate styling that complements the design
3. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain proper spacing and visual hierarchy
4. IF a beta indicator is needed THEN it SHALL be styled consistently with the overall design system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the footer and bottom sections to have proper spacing and visual breathing room, so that the content doesn't feel cramped or overwhelming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the footer THEN elements SHALL have adequate spacing between them
2. WHEN viewing the bottom sections THEN vertical spacing SHALL create visual separation
3. WHEN content is displayed in the footer THEN it SHALL not appear condensed or cluttered
4. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN spacing SHALL remain proportional and comfortable
